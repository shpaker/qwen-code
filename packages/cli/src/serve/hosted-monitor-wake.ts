// H3 of #12827: the embedded scheduler that makes a Monitor wake
// effective. A monitor observation commits its notification input and its
// `wake.requested` in one transaction; this pump turns that pending input
// into a runnable activation. A busy Session queues the input in the
// journal exactly like a channel or Goal input — the pump re-reads the
// journal, so nothing is held in memory and a restart re-derives the
// pending set. A Session that is blocked keeps its reminders pending and
// reports them accurately; a closing Session settles its notifications
// model-free on the close path. See
// docs/design/2026-10-03-managed-shell-monitor-runtime.md.
